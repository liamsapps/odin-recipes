			<h2>Steps</h2>
			<div class="meatballs">
				<h3>Meatballs</h3>
				<ol>
					<li>Combine the milk and breadcrumbs. Place the breadcrumbs in a small bowl, 
						pour in the milk, and stir to combine. Set aside while preparing the rest 
						of the meatball mixture. The breadcrumbs will absorb the milk and become soggy.</li>
					<li>Whisk the egg, salt, pepper, Parmesan, and parsley. Whisk the egg in a large bowl 
						until broken up. Add the Parmesan, parsley, salt, and a generous quantity of black 
						pepper, and whisk to combine.</li>
					<li>Add the ground meat. Add the meat to the egg mixture. Use your hands to thoroughly 
						mix the egg mixture into the ground meat.</li>
					<li>Add the onions and soaked breadcrumbs. Add the onions, garlic, and soaked breadcrumbs. 
						Mix them thoroughly into the meat with your fingers. Try not to overwork the meat; pinch 
						the meat between your fingers rather than kneading it.</li>
					<li>Form the meat into meatballs. Have a bowl or plate ready. Pinch off a piece of the meat 
						mixture and gently roll between your hands to form 1 1/2-inch meatballs (about 2 tablespoons 
						each). Continue shaping until all the meat is used, placing the meatballs on the dish so that 
						they are not touching.</li>
					<li>Place a large pot on medium high heat with a tablespoon of olive oil.</li>
					<li>Cook the meatballs, <strong>turning frequently</strong>, for 5-10 minutes.</li>
				</ol>
			</div>			
			<div class="sauce">
				<h3>Sauce</h3>
				<p>I like to cook my sauce in the same pot as the meatballs.</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Using the same pot with the meatballs, on medium high heat, add the chopped onions 
						and minced garlic.</li>
					<li>Let the mixture cook for 10-15 minutes.</li>
					<li>Stir in tin tomatoes and tomato paste, as well as, italian seasoning, chili peppers 
						(if desired), and salt. Cover, reduce heat to medium, and cook for 45 minutes. 
						<strong>Remember to stir occassionaly!</strong></li>
					<li>Reduce to low heat and simmer for an additional 30 minutes.</li>
				</ol>
			</div>
			<div class="pasta">
				<h3>Pasta</h3>
				<ol>
					<li>Bring a large pot of water to a boil.</li>
					<li>Add the pasta to the pot.</li>
					<li><em>Follow the instructions provided for the chosen pasta (refer to the package).</em></li>
					<li>Once cooked, drain the pasta</li>
				</ol>
