# HTML Recipe Project

This is a project to _showcase_ my **HTML skills**.

### HTML Skills

- boilerplate HTML `<!DOCTYPE>,<html>,<head>,<body>`
- using the heading hierarchy `<h1>...<h6>`
- separating blocks of text using paragraphs `<p>`
- working with ordered and unordered lists `<ul><li> , <ol><li>`
- linking many site pages together with links `<a>`
- displaying images `<img>`

I have also become more familiar with git and github. First, understanding that a git project has three parts: 

- working directory 
- staging area 
- repository 

The basic Git workflow goes something like this:

- modify files in your working directory
- selectively stage just those changes you want to be part of your next commit, which adds only those changes to the staging area
- do a commit, which takes the files as they are in the staging area and stores that snapshot permanently to your Git directory

I am also getting in the habit of making atomic commits. As soon as a change is made, commit.
